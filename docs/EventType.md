# LicenseManager.Model.EventType
- `policy.created`: `payload` holds the policy's settings. - `policy.updated`: `payload.changes` maps each changed field to its previous (`from`) and new (`to`) value. Making a policy the default also updates the previous default one. - `license.created`: `payload` holds the license's key, `policyId`, `customerId` and settings. Not linked to the policy. - `license.updated`: `payload.changes`, like `policy.updated`. - `license.validated`: a machine validated the license key. `payload` holds the machine's `fingerprint`, `name` and `version`, and whether the validation created the machine (`machineCreated`) or activated it again (`machineActivated`). - `license.validation_failed`: validating the license key failed. `payload` holds the error `code` and `message`, and the `fingerprint`, `name`, `platform` and `version` sent, the name and platform being the machine's when none is sent. Linked to the machine when it exists. - `machine.deactivated`: a machine was deactivated, so it no longer counts as using the license. `payload` holds the machine's `fingerprint` and `name`. Linked to the license and the machine.  An update that changes nothing records no event. Deletions record no events, and customers, products and releases have none.
